Hey Lee,

I could give you a hand full of code examples. This should help you to communicate with the LC.

 

Generating a TCPIP object:

tcpObject = tcpip(192.168.1.100,Port Number) %concerning to the manual the IP Address is fixed

fopen(tcoObject);

to send a command to the LC use following code:

fwrite(tcpObject,uint8(hex2dec(['02';'01';'01';'00';'01';'00';'00';'05']))); %switch display mode to static

fwrite(tcpObject,uint8(hex2dec(['02';'01';'01';'00';'01';'00';'01';'06']))); %siwtch display mode to internal

fwrite(tcpObject,uint8(hex2dec(['02';'01';'03';'00';'01';'00';'00';'07']))); %switch to internal pattern: checkboard

 

Use the DLP LightCrafter DM365 Command Interface Guide to get the necessary information for the commands.

Hopefully I prevent you from headache ;)

Hi there,

I am also attempting to integrate the Lightcrafter into matlab.

Trying to decipher your code via the DLPC300 Programmerâ€™s Guide is not giving me the most luck. 

Could you please just give me a quick map of what each of those hex decimals represent in for example:

fwrite(tcpObject,uint8(hex2dec(['02';'01';'01';'00';'01';'00';'00';'05']))); %switch display mode to static

I know that the sequence to interface must be 
START Condition, Slave Address Byte + R/W Bit, Sub-Address Byte, N-Data Bytes, STOP Condition

so something like:
S 37 00 00 00 00 P would make sense to me for a write situation.

Although im confused as to what exactly your  code refers to for each hex value.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
